# FitTrackr

> A web application where users can set goals for their fitness and health and track their progress over time. Users should be able to create and log their own workout sessions and meals. User data is visualized through various types of graphs. Examples of data that can be visualized include weight loss over time and running distance for each week of the past month.

# Development

1. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2. Run development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

3. Open the url [`localhost:5137`](http://localhost:5173/) in your browser.

## What weâ€™ve done:

- User prototype testing (30 min)

- **Login**: Users can log in through Google and email and their information persists across sessions.
- **Profile**: Users can add personal information like weight and height.
- **Overview**: Provides a high-level view and statistics on goals and workouts.
- **Add Workouts**: Exercises are fetched from an API and the user can create custom workouts, and save them (stored on Firebase).
- **My Workouts**: Shows users their past and upcoming workouts.
- **Goals**: Users can set goals (currently only a few different options).
- **Progress**: Users can track statistics on workouts and progress towards their goals. The data is visualized through various graphs from ReCharts. Currently, the data on the progress page is randomly generated and not linked to logged workouts. Most of the data about workouts are pulled from the real workout data.

## What we plan to do:

We still need to connect the completed workouts to the goals and the progress view. Right now, the Goals and Workouts are completely independent and implemented using placeholder data. This needs to be updated such that the views use the relevant data from the profile. We still have to add meals and count calories consumed each day in order to get the calories calculated correctly. We need to add responsiveness for the pages /goals and /progress. The goals and progress page should also display a spinning wheel while waiting for data from Pirebase

Users should also be able to add data about weight and time when they create the workouts. We also plan to make the sidebar invisible when the user is not logged in.

When all of the above are implemented, a user evaluation of the platform needs to be conducted and feedback from that needs to be implemented.
